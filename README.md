# Image Warping on Android
> This is a part of the group project I had to make. It allows to apply certain warping methods to a given picture to show how they work.

## More Info
For more information about the project please read the "user guide and documentation" pdf file. 

## TODO
* Restructurisation would be nice.
* Option to apply changes and undo them without the need of saving the outcome and reloading it to apply next effect
* More warping methods
*
